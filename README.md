# Kinetics Game

A two dimensional simulation of rigid body kinetics. Bodies have mass and velocity, and interact with each other through gravitational attraction and elastic collision. New bodies can be spawned with the mouse.

## Running

`npm start` runs the project in a dev server and opens the browser. `npm run deploy` pushes a production build of the game to the `gh-pages` branch of the `origin` remote.
